make full chart ordering better
ideas:
1. group by unit, or by item number within unit, projects off to side
2. consolidate arrows

command-line:
-new chart type that focuses on a specific topic


TODO

-no borders for group id, don't show label for group id either
-fix border inconsistency on events
